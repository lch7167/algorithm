Implement strStr().
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
//

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if needle in haystack: #needle이 haystack안에 있으면
            return haystack.index(needle) #needle의 인덱스 반환
        else: #없으면 -1리턴
            return -1
